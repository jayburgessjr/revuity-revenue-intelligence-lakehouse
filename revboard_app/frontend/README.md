# RevBoard Frontend (Placeholder)

In Lovable or another app builder, this would be a small web app that:

- Calls the `/kpis` and `/funnel` endpoints from the backend.
- Renders KPI cards for MRR, ARR, CAC, and LTV.
- Renders a funnel chart from the funnel endpoint.
- Shows a simple "Advisory Feed" with plain-language insights.

This placeholder exists so hiring managers can see how the frontend fits into
the overall repo structure.
