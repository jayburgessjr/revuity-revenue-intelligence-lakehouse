# Revuity Revenue Intelligence Lakehouse

This repository is a demo of an end-to-end revenue data system for **Revuity Analytics**.

It shows how Revuity might implement a Databricks-powered *Revenue Intelligence Lakehouse* plus a lightweight **RevBoard** app on top.

## What this repo demonstrates

- Revenue advisory thinking: how we define revenue metrics, funnels, and personas.
- Databricks-style lakehouse implementation: bronze / silver / gold pattern with Delta-like tables.
- A simple RevBoard API and UI concept for revenue management software.

This is designed as a hiring-manager-friendly and client-friendly artifact:
you can walk through it in interviews, screenshare the structure, and talk through the design decisions.
